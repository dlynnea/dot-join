A social networking application built with React, Node, Express and MongoDB. I utilized JSON Web Tokens for user authentication, allowing a user to sign up, login and interac

## Getting Started

To get started, clone this repository in your terminal.

### Description

Begin using this appalication with creating an account. Once you have an account, you can build up you profile, including interests, skills, a bio, etc. I built this with a network such as Linkedin in mind, therefore you can also include education and experience to build upon your profile. Within the application you can interact with other users by creating posts, commenting on others posts, and liking posts.

### Features to come

I plan to integrate a file upload system so that if/when a user is not associated with a Gravatar account they have the option to upload a profile photo.
